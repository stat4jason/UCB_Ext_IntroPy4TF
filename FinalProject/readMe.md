This is the folder for Zhicheng (Jason) Xue and Shiwen (GiGi) Wang's final project for X433.7 machine learning with TensorFlow.

The data used for this project can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data. The name is loan.csv. Due to its size greater than 25 MB, we could not upload to GitHub. We will include the zipped data file with the email in case you find it hard to download the data file from the website.

Please note that Part V in the code is the section where you can find our TensorFlow models while the other codes are either data preparations, exploratory data analysis and scikit learn model.


In order to run the program, you need to get all the packages listed in the code from Anaconda(Final_Project_X4337.py) and data(loan.csv). We suggest to use Anaconda and Jupiter notebook to run the code to avoid certain errors. If you want to compare against our results, please check the uploaded Jupyter Notebook file and all the pictures in the folder.

All the modules needed: numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, tensorflow, sklearn.
PLEASE USE conda install and create a virtual environment under Anaconda using source activate tensorflow!
